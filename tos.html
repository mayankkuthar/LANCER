        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of such a claim, or if we believe that such a claim is likely, we may, at our sole option and expense: (a) modify the Subscription Service or provide you with substitute Subscription Service that is non-infringing; or (b) obtain a license or permission for you to continue to use the Subscription Service, at no additional cost to you; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is, in our judgment, commercially practicable, terminate your access to the Subscription Service (or to a portion of the Subscription Service as necessary to resolve the claimed infringement) and refund any prepaid but unused fees covering use of the Subscription Service after termination in accordance with the ‘Effect of Termination or Expiration’ provision of this Agreement. THIS SECTION STATES OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS SECTION.</p>

        </ol>
